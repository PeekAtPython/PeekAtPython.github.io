## **Python Syntax**

Python's syntax is designed to be clean and easy to read. Let's explore some fundamental aspects.

### **Indentation Matters**

In Python, indentation isn't just for readabilityâ€”it's part of the syntax. Blocks of code are defined by their
indentation level, typically using 4 spaces.

**Example:**

```python
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two.")
    print("This line is part of the if block.")
print("This line is outside the if block.")
```

**Notes:**

- Consistent indentation is crucial.
- Mixing tabs and spaces can lead to errors.
- The standard is 4 spaces per indentation level.

### **No Braces or Semicolons**

Python does not use curly braces `{}` to define code blocks or semicolons `;` to end statements.

**Example:**

```python
# Correct in Python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Incorrect (this would cause an error)
def greet(name){
    print(f"Hello, {name}!");
}
```

### **Case Sensitivity**

Python is case-sensitive. This means `Variable` and `variable` are two different identifiers.

**Example:**

```python
age = 25
Age = 30

print(age)  # Outputs: 25
print(Age)  # Outputs: 30
```

### **Dynamic Typing**

You don't need to declare variable types. Assigning a value to a variable declares and initializes it.

```python
my_var = 10       # Integer
my_var = 'Ten'    # Now it's a String
```
