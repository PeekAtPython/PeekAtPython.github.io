## **How To Install**

Before you can start coding in Python, you need to install it on your system. Here’s how to get started:

### **Step 1: Download Python**

- Visit the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- Navigate to the **Downloads** section and download the latest version of Python for your operating system (Windows,
  macOS, or Linux).

### **Step 2: Install Python**

- Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
- Make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation. This makes it easier to run Python
  from the command line.

### **Step 3: Verify Installation**

Open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
  python --version
 ```
  If Python is installed correctly, you’ll see the version number (e.g., `Python 3.11.5`).

## **Python IDEs**

There are several Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) available for Python. Some popular options include:

- **PyCharm**: A powerful IDE (developed by JetBrains) with intelligent code completion and debugging capabilities.
  Available in both free and
  paid versions. PyCharm is the best IDE for Python in my opinion.

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: A lightweight, open-source code editor with Python support through extensions. It's
  free and highly customizable.

- **Notepad++**: A simple text editor with Python syntax highlighting.

- **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live
  code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

- **Spyder**: A scientific Python development environment that provides advanced editing, interactive testing,
  debugging, and introspection features.
