## **Getting Started in Python**

Letâ€™s write your first Python program: **Hello, World!**

### **Step 1: Open a Text Editor or IDE**

You can use any text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text) or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like
PyCharm or Jupyter Notebook.

### **Step 2: Write the Code**

Create a new file and type the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### **Step 3: Run the Program**

- Save the file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `hello.py`).
- Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where the file is saved, and run:

```bash
python hello.py
```

- You should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! Youâ€™ve just written and executed your first Python program.
