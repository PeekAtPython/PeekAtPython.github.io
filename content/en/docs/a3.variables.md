## **Variables**

A **variable** in Python is a named reference to a value stored in memory. Python uses **dynamic typing**, meaning you
don’t need to declare a variable’s type—it’s determined at runtime based on the assigned value.

In simple terms, a variable is like a labeled box where you can store different types of information, such as numbers,
words, or lists.

``` python
x = 10      # Integer variable
name = "Alice"  # String variable
price = 99.99  # Float variable
is_valid = True  # Boolean variable
```

Python automatically assigns the correct data type to each variable based on the assigned value.

Python allows you to assign **multiple variables in a single line**:

```python
name, age, is_student = "Bob", 30, True
print(name) # Output: Bob
print(age)  # Output: 30
print(is_student)  # Output: True
```

### **Naming Rules for Variables**

- Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (_)
- Cannot start with a number
- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
- Case-sensitive (`name` and `Name` are different variables)
- Should not be a Python keyword (e.g., `class`, `if`, `def`, etc.)

## **Constants in Python**

Python does not have built-in constant support, but by convention, constants are written in uppercase letters:

```python
PI = 3.14159
GRAVITY = 9.8
```

By convention, we do not change the values of constants after they are defined.
